Project 1 for CS 538 Knowledge Discovery and Data MIning


Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Total Points: 100
Given Out: Week 2: Friday, August 30th, 2024
Due Date: First stage - Week 3: Thursday, Sept 5th, 2024
Second stage - Week 5: Thursday, Sept 19th, 2024
Project is to be done individually.

Background & Introduction: 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical initial step in the
data analysis process. It involves the use of various statistical tools and techniques to explore
and summarize datasets, allowing data analysts to uncover underlying patterns, spot anomalies,
and test hypotheses. EDA serves as a foundation for understanding the data's structure,
distribution, and relationships before applying more complex modeling techniques.
The goal of this project is to engage you in the practice of EDA, guiding the application of
various techniques to a real-world dataset. Through this project, hands-on experience will be
gained in cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting data, which are essential skills in data science.
This assignment will challenge you to think critically about the data, ask the right questions, and
use appropriate tools to extract actionable insights.
Keypoints: Before we outline the specific tasks, we would like to emphasize the importance of
creativity in the project. The way you explore, visualize, and interpret the data plays a pivotal
role. Most of the questions are open-ended, and a creative approach/vision to EDA can
distinguish your work. The more innovative your explorations, the higher the scores you stand to
achieve. Dive deep, and let your analytical creativity lead the way!
Python Environment: You are welcome to use whatever IDE you think works best. As
examples, you might consider:
1. Anaconda: A comprehensive open-source platform.
2. Colab: A cloud-based platform by Google.
3. PyCharm: A robust IDE from JetBrains.
Submission and Deliverables: You will submit the project through Canvas, following a two-
stage submission process.
In the first stage, the focus is on selecting a dataset that is both interesting and substantial for
your analysis. This is your chance to choose a topic that captures your curiosity and apply EDA
techniques to explore it in depth. Also, you are free to choose any dataset for this project, with
no restrictions on its type. Whether you're interested in text from articles or reviews, images of
different subjects, or tabular data with structured information, it's all up to you. You will have one
week to complete this stage.
The submission of the first stage includes a .pdf file or .docx file (see Task 1). Due date is
Thursday, Sept 5th, 2024.

The second stage involves diving into the analysis of your chosen dataset. Here, you'll apply the
full range of EDA techniques to uncover insights, identify patterns, and address any anomalies
within the data. Due date is Thursday, Sept 19th, 2024.
The submission includes two separate files (DO NOT compress your files to .zip): (1) A report
that provides the tasks detailed below accompanied by explanations and (2) execution source
codes that can reproduce the reported results.
1. Your report doc can be a .pdf file or .docx file. The file needs to contain the results (e.g.,
figures, tables) of each task and your analysis. If your answer contains figures/images,
please take a screenshot or download them, and then insert them into your results doc.
2. Your code can be .py file or .ipynb file.
Using Generative-AI (e.g., ChatGPT): I encourage responsible and sensible use in
assignment. Please report if, how, and what you used to complete the assignment. Explain how
you validated the trustworthiness of the solution, which prompt/s you used, and you used the
output of the model (basic code/documentation/etc.)
Demonstration: Once completed, several students may be asked to provide a brief
demonstration of their results to your classmates. The instructor/TA may also request a one-on-
one demonstration to support grading.
Discussion: There is a discussion section on Canvas where you can ask any questions that
you have about project 1.

Task 1 [10 points]
Craft a compelling introduction for your project. Describe the dataset that you are going to use,
introduce the background, explain its significance, and share your motivation for choosing it.
You don’t have to finalize the specific problem that you are going to work on just yet but you
should have a sense of what you are targeting. Also, provide characteristics of your dataset
such as number of rows and columns. Due date is Thursday, Sept 5th, 2024.
Dataset requirements: If you choose tabular data, it should contain at least 20 different
features of different types and at least 200,000 records (rows). No particular requirements for
textual/image/other data.
Good resources for datasets:
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/
• https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/

Task 2 [10 points]
Provide statistical summaries of the data. Please show at least five different types of
summaries, and analysis your findings. Use these observations to learn and communicate (in
your reports) something about the data. Simple examples include number of samples,
attributes, column names, if missing values are present, quartiles etc.

Task 3 [25 points]
Perform exploratory analysis on the data. Research online for ideas, and then show analysis on
at least five different aspects of the dataset. Analyze your findings.
Note: This part is open-ended. Any valid analysis is fine. Use visualizations when necessary.

Task 4 [40 points]
Perform exploratory analysis to answer questions. Design at least three questions by yourself
and use the data to answer. For example:
1. Socio-economic Factors and Their Relation to Suicide Rates: Analyze the relationship
between suicide rates and economic indicators in the dataset, such as GDP and GDP
per capita.
2. Geographical Analysis of Suicide Rates: Combine the dataset with other sources of
geographical information to determine if there's a correlation between suicide rates and
factors like geography, climate, or culture.
Note 1: Be creative and use visualizations when necessary.
Note 2: You are welcome to search for external information; yet, in order to use it you have to
integrate it with the provided dataset.

Task 5 [15 points]
Explore biases in this dataset. Raise at least three concerns related to bias and write
summaries of your findings. For example:
1. Demographic Bias: All age groups, genders, and other demographics within countries
should be represented equitably.
2. Data Collection Methods Bias: If different countries or regions use different methods or
standards for data collection, this can lead to inconsistencies or biases in the reported
figures.

Opportunity Act (ECOA).
